# About Me
Hello stranger,

My name is Alexandro Valdez and I'm a recent graduate from Stephen F. Austin State University. Throughout my time at SFA I studied a wide variety of related classes such as:
- Data Structures
- Algorithm Analysis
- Database Managment Systems
- Internet Programming Concepts
- Object Oriented Programming
- Microcomputer Interfacing
to name a few.

Due to the unprecedented events following COVID-19 I decided to take on the task of becoming a remote coding instructor for CodeWizardsHQ â€” an online coding school based out of Austin, Texas. I teach students ages 6 - 18 and predominantly teach: JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, jQuery, and A-Frame.js. I try to teach my students not only about coding but also about life. I constantly try to tie in anacdotes, stories, and mistakes from my own life in order to further enrich their educational development.

Outside of work I enjoy practicing brazilian jiu jitsu, working on my 1993 240sx, and continued learning in UiPath and the MERN stack.

Despite my current position as a coding instructor I'm also currently on the hunt for a position as a software developer. If you're a hiring manager, software developer, or just someone stopping by who may have leads on a potential position please send them my way!

Thank you for stopping by and I hope you have a great day!

~Alexandro Valdez
