# hello-world
Hello stranger,

My name is Alexandro Valdez!
I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Stephen F. Austin State University.
I'm currently a "Remote Coding Instructor", but I'm hoping to land my first job as a software developer very soon.
I teach a variety of classes: Javascript, Python, HTML5/CSS3, A-Frame, and jQuery.
Outside of teaching I enjoy studying ReactJS and UiPath.
